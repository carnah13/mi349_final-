<h1 id='Info1' class='section-heading'>Our Story</h2>
Aunt Paigeâ€™s Basement University (APBU) was founded upon the beginning of the fall semester of 2020 as a replacement for students who were 
forced to stay home during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has since then grown to support its two founding students as they completed their fall 
semesters. Our students consist of Randy and Paige. Randy is a guest student from Michigan State University studying computer science engineering. 
Paige is a guest student from Oakland University getting her degree is human resources management. Together combined with the resources provided 
by APBU, Google, and Quizlet, the students were able to navigate their courses with high efficiency. </p>

<p>Here at APBU we believe that students should have the flexibility of learning from wherever the pandemic takes them. APBU offered an alternative 
fall break this semester which allowed its students to study from various remote locations such as a cabin in the woods as well as Disney World.
