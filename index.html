<p><img src='island.jpg' alt='Island Beach' width="250" height="150" class="beach-pic" >On our trip to Georgia I drove down to Saint Simons Island with my friends Paige and Liz so we could pickup Paige’s grandma. Our trip had a great start as we all chugged red bulls once we left my house and started making our way to Ohio. We drove all night straight through and made it to grandma’s rental on the island the next morning. 
We only smoked two opossums along the way with minimal damage to Liz’s car. Once we arrived, we passed out and decided to make our way to the beach. The view was spectacular, and the ocean was surprisingly warm. The beach was probably the coolest part of the whole trip because I have never seen the tides have such a huge effect on the water levels. 
We had to move our chairs back every 15 minutes because the water was moving up so fast at some points. The week we drove down was the same week that the new Animal Crossing game for Switch came out, so we spent plenty on time soaking up some sun and building our islands. Throughout the week we also spent a lot of time touring the islands many shops 
and restaurants. We did so with the help of bikes that we were able to rent. Along our route we also got to see the island airport as well as experience a flat tire which cut our ride short and created a long walk back to the shop. One-night grandma took us to one of the historical parks on the island where we got to see a tree spirit and many works of art. 
There was even a mini golf course close by, so we got to stop and play a few holes. As great of a time we were having and enjoying our escape from Michigan’s cold weather, we did have to cut our trip short because of COVID. Grandma decided that it was best if we packed her up early and got back home as soon as possible. We did convince her to give us one 
more day however the next day the beach was shut down to promote social distancing so there was nothing much to do. I personally was able to take a long run around the island and see some very cool nature spots. After all was said in done, we ended up packing up grandma the next day and started our trip back home. We were greeted with some very nasty rain 
and sleet weather which was a horrible reminder of the cold climate we were heading back too. Overall, the trip was a huge success, and we made some great memories, and I hope we can return to Saint Simons Island someday.

<p>I began working at the store when I was 16. When I was originally hired, I started as a cart pusher and never had any intent of working past that summer. Now three years later I’m still using the store to help put myself through college. As a cart pusher I was responsible for clearing a lot of carts and trash. In this position I went through a couple 
different managers being Marie, Dan, and Lynn. Once I turned 18, I was able to get cashier trained and soon after my role was changed from cart pusher to cashier. In this position I found that I hated running a check lane but liked working the self-checkouts. There I was able to freely move around rather than being tied to a single lane. After working as a 
cashier for a few months I realized that I wanted to do more and given my interest in IT I talked to my manager Lisa about being moved to the systems team. There my co-worker Amy trained me in all things pertaining to fixing the registers, performing maintenance/cleaning, and how to audit the different departments. It was here in this role that I realized 
what I wanted to do with my programming degree. I want to use my degree to program retail systems such as the checkout experience and systems that handle back end processes such as inventory. I was able to be in the systems role until I left for college the first time where I had a replacement come in. When I came home from breaks, they had me fill in wherever 
I was needed which allowed for a lot of schedule flexibility. When I came home from school because of the pandemic we had yet another boss named Dan. I expressed to Dan that I was interested in a leadership position but since I couldn’t work full time and be a team leader, he allowed me to try being a service coordinator. Quickly after I was trained in this 
role as well as the service desk since a bit of my time as a coordinator would be spent there. Over the summer I kept gaining more and more expertise in this role and even started helping to train new coordinators and desk clerks. Now I have my hopes set on an even bigger promotion. Meijer has summer internships and I’m trying to get selected for one of the IT 
or programming roles. Last year I wasn’t selected since I was only a freshman. However, this year I was moved on to the interview rounds and am patiently awaiting a response on further action from the hiring manager. I really hope that I can keep moving up within my company and build a future with it.
